# ImageWalkTracker
ImageWalkTracker is a test project that enables you to track your walk with images.

The user opens the app and presses the start button. After that the user puts their phone into their pocket and starts walking. 
The app requests a photo from the flickr photo search api every 100 meters to add to the stream. New pictures are added on top. 
Whenever the user takes a look at their phone, they see the most recent picture and can scroll through a stream of pictures which shows where the user has been. 
It should work for at least a two-hour walk. 
The user interface is simple, just a table view with images and a start/stop button on the right top corner.
